## *Iris Species Classification using Machine Learning*

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of three supervised machine learning algorithms — *Logistic Regression, **Decision Tree, and **K-Nearest Neighbors* — to classify iris flower species based on their physical characteristics.

### *Dataset*
The classic *Iris dataset* from scikit-learn, which contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica), with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

### *Workflow*
- Data preprocessing using LabelEncoder and feature scaling
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training three models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
- Evaluating model performance using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix
- Visualizing:
  - Confusion matrices for each model using heatmaps
  - Accuracy comparison using bar chart

### *Tools & Libraries*
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

### *Results*
Each model was evaluated on the same test set and compared using accuracy scores and classification reports. A bar chart visualizes the accuracy of each model side-by-side for quick comparison.
